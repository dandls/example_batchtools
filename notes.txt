General commands: 
ls  					list files
cd [path]				change directory
mv [old file path] [new file path]	move a file  
rm  [file path]				remove file 
cat [file path]				view file
htop 					see which processes are running --> quit with q
pkill -f 'R'				cancel all processes in R 

Make small edits: 
nano [file path]			edit file 

Example Makefile: 
benchmark : 
	R CMD BATCH run_study.R  

Setup evaluation: 
libs.R					Load packages 
def.R vs. def_test.R			Definitions (effiency parameters (#models, #reps, storage parameters (file names, registry name))
run.R					Methods (functions that call methods, necessary parameter instance) 
dgp.R 					Problems (data frame with study setup in my case, calls function to create datasets)) 
run_study.R 				Batchtools setup that calls all three files above, rm(list = ls()) important  
(makeExperimentRegistry, addProblem, addAlgorithm, addExperiment, submitJobs, waitForJobs)
(get_results.R 				Postprocess results table from batchtools, reduceResultsDataTable, saveRDS)

Run study: 
nohup [command] & 			conduct action in background (no termination by closing)	
e.g. nohup make benchmark & 
.out files will be created with printouts 


Workflow: 
Make major changes on local machine, push to github, pull to external machine and just run nohup make [...] & on it.
